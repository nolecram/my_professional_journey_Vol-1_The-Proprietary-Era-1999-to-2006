# TeleAp

## Company Overview

**TeleAp** (Telemedia Applicazioni S.p.A.) was founded in 1995 as the Olivetti Group's specialist in Customer Relationship Management and Contact Center solutions. The company developed proprietary telephony tools and built deep expertise in Siebel CRM while integrating technologies from strategic partners such as Ericsson, Cisco, and Genesys. This focus on specialized telecom and CRM solutions positioned TeleAp as a niche but technically sophisticated player in Italy's enterprise IT landscape.

The company's trajectory reflected broader consolidation in the Italian IT services sector. In 2001, TeleAp was incorporated into Webegg, Olivetti's consulting and systems integration arm, where it expanded its role beyond pure product development into full-scale digital transformation projects. By 2004, TeleAp was merged into Value Team, the IT consulting and solutions company created by Value Partners through the consolidation of Webegg and other technology firms. Within Value Team, TeleAp continued to grow, becoming part of one of Italy's leading system integrators. The consolidation trend continued: in 2011, Value Team was acquired by NTT DATA, completing TeleAp's transformation from a niche Olivetti subsidiary into part of a global IT services powerhouse.

## The Transition from Atos to TeleAp

Arriving at TeleAp in September 2000 represented a shift from the infrastructure-heavy, telephony-focused work at Atos to a more customer-centric, business solutions approach. Where Atos centered on the technical plumbing—keeping Project 119's call center infrastructure running—TeleAp's work was about making CRM systems and contact center solutions actually serve business processes and customer interactions.

The transition arrived at a distinctive moment: the dot-com bubble was inflating, and enterprise software was being positioned as the answer to digital transformation. Siebel CRM, Oracle, and enterprise integration platforms promised to revolutionize customer management. For a company like TeleAp, this created opportunity. The challenge was to bridge the gap between vendor promises and operational reality—to integrate systems that weren't designed to work together, to build solutions that actually delivered business value, and to help clients navigate the complexity of enterprise technology adoption.

---

## Technology Focus

At TeleAp, the core technology involved **Siebel CRM implementations** integrated with **contact center solutions** from vendors like Genesys and Cisco. The work centered on bringing together multiple vendor platforms—Siebel for customer data, contact center software for call routing and management, Ericsson or Cisco for telephony, and Oracle databases to store it all—and creating solutions that let customers actually use these systems to manage their business.

Unlike infrastructure management at Atos, this work was closer to the customer's actual needs. The question wasn't "will the system stay up?" (though that mattered), but "can we build a solution that helps this customer understand and serve their clients better?" This required understanding not just the technology but the business logic underneath—how customers engaged, what data mattered, how processes should flow.

### CRM as a Business Transformation Tool

Siebel CRM was the era's defining enterprise application. It was massive, complex, expensive, and the implementation methodology was equally heavyweight: months of requirements gathering, detailed process mapping, customization of business logic, data migration from legacy systems. Every implementation was large-scale and risky. A failed Siebel deployment didn't just mean a failed IT project—it meant the client couldn't manage customer relationships effectively.

The typical engagement cycle was: discovery and requirements (months), system design and customization (months), testing and refinement (weeks), cutover and go-live (intense period with on-call teams standing by), and then months of stabilization and optimization. The waterfall methodology from Atos was still present, but this time embedded within business processes and organizational change management.

The contact center piece added another dimension: the system had to handle real-time call routing, screen population from CRM data, agent scripting, quality monitoring. This required integrating computer-telephone integration (CTI) with CRM, making the systems communicate in real time. When the telephony and CRM data didn't sync properly, agents couldn't do their jobs—the integration had to work flawlessly.

---

## The Reality of CRM Integration

What Siebel promised in theory and what it delivered in practice were often different things. The system was powerful but inflexible. Customization meant coding within Siebel's proprietary scripting language (Siebel Tools and eScript). Integrations to other systems required middleware and custom development. Data quality was often the real challenge—organizations had spent years accumulating incomplete, inconsistent customer data, and Siebel didn't magically fix that.

Successful implementations required discipline: rigorous requirements gathering to avoid scope creep, disciplined change management as organizations shifted to new processes, careful data cleansing before migration. Organizations that treated Siebel as a magic solution often struggled. Those that treated it as a tool that would only be as good as their process design and data quality usually succeeded.

The experience at TeleAp exposed the gap between what enterprise software could actually deliver and what executives hoped it would deliver. Technology was necessary but never sufficient—the hard part was always organizational. How do you get a large organization to change how they work? How do you build in the discipline to maintain data quality? How do you handle the resistance from people whose jobs or authority structures were being disrupted by new systems?

## Professional Learning & Impact

Working on CRM implementations taught lessons that proved durable. First: enterprise software implementation is as much organizational change management as it is technical. Second: integration points are where systems fail—the more vendors involved, the more complexity and risk. Third: data quality is foundational; garbage in, garbage out applies absolutely to CRM systems. Fourth: scope management is essential; every out-of-scope request accepted creates risk and delay.

The shift from infrastructure-focused work to business solutions work required developing new skills: understanding business processes, translating business requirements into technical specifications, managing expectations with both technical teams and client stakeholders. The infrastructure work at Atos had been about keeping systems running. The CRM work at TeleAp was about making systems deliver business value.

### The Contact Center Evolution

The contact center technology of 2000–2003 was a distinctive moment. Genesys and Cisco dominated the market with sophisticated call routing, automatic call distribution, and agent management tools. These systems were specialized hardware and software, vendor-locked, expensive, and powerful. They had to be—managing thousands of concurrent calls, routing to the right agent based on skills and availability, recording and analyzing calls, integrating with CRM to show agents customer history—this was genuinely complex technology.

The integration challenge was significant: getting CRM data to appear on the agent's screen at the moment a call arrived, routing calls based on CRM information, recording call outcomes back into CRM. This required CTI middleware, custom integration code, careful timing and synchronization. When it worked, it was genuinely sophisticated. When it didn't, customers lost visibility into calls and agent productivity suffered.

Within a decade, much of this would be abstracted or outsourced. Cloud-based contact center platforms (Five9, Amazon Connect, Genesys Cloud) would offer hosted solutions without the capital investment in specialized hardware. Siebel itself would be superseded by Salesforce, which was designed cloud-first and with better out-of-the-box integration capabilities. The specialized contact center knowledge became less essential as the platforms themselves evolved.

But the principles—understanding customer interactions, integrating systems around customer data, managing the complexity of multi-vendor integration—remained relevant.

## On the Evolution of CRM and Customer Solutions

The Siebel CRM implementations of 2000–2003 feel almost archaeological now. Siebel itself still exists but is essentially a legacy system in the Salesforce suite. The heavy customization model has been replaced by configuration-driven platforms. The on-premise massive database infrastructure has moved to cloud. The contact center specialization has largely dissolved as cloud platforms handle what once required deep expertise.

Yet the core learning remains: successful customer solutions require understanding customer processes, discipline in implementation, quality data, and rigorous integration between systems. The specific platforms changed. The principles didn't.

## Team, Culture, and the Shift Toward Solutions-Based Work

TeleAp operated differently from Atos. Where Atos was infrastructure-focused and waterfall-driven, TeleAp was more solutions-oriented. The team structure reflected this: business analysts worked alongside technical architects, requirements gathering was more extensive, customer interaction was more direct. Project managers were managing not just technical delivery but also organizational change—helping clients transition from old ways of working to new processes enabled by Siebel.

The culture was also different. Atos had been about operational excellence and managing complexity. TeleAp was about understanding customer business and translating that into technology solutions. The work was less about keeping systems running 24/7 and more about successful project delivery and customer satisfaction.

The consolidations—TeleAp into Webegg, Webegg into Value Team—happened during the tenure. These reflected broader industry trends: smaller specialized firms being consolidated into larger system integrators with broader capabilities. The advantage of consolidation was scale and broader service offerings. The disadvantage was that some of the specialized focus got diluted. A pure CRM firm became one division within a larger IT services company with many other offerings.

## Historical Context: The Italian IT Services Consolidation Wave

TeleAp's trajectory from 1995 to 2011—from Olivetti subsidiary to Webegg to Value Team to NTT DATA—reflected a broader pattern in European IT services. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw smaller, specialized firms being progressively consolidated into larger national and international players. This was driven by several factors: globalization of clients (they wanted IT partners with international reach), the shift toward larger integrated projects (smaller firms lacked scale), consolidation among vendors themselves (Siebel, Oracle, SAP all consolidating their market positions), and the capital requirements of growing professional services firms.

By the early 2010s, much of the Italian IT services sector had been consolidated into a handful of large players and their subsidiaries. Some, like TeleAp through Value Team, were acquired by international firms (NTT DATA). Others remained Italian-controlled but much larger. The specialized niches—a company that focused deeply on Siebel CRM, or contact center solutions, or a specific industry vertical—became less viable as standalone entities.

The experience of TeleAp from 2000 onward was of being part of this consolidation trend: absorbed into larger organizations, reorganized around different strategic priorities, but with the underlying technical expertise and customer relationships continuing to matter.
