# Atos

## Company Overview

**Atos** is an international information technology services and consulting company. Atos Italy was established in the late 1990s as part of the French IT services group Atos, which had been created in 1997 from the merger of Axime and Sligos. In 2000, following the global merger between Atos and the Dutch company Origin B.V., the Italian branch became part of the newly formed **Atos Origin**, a pan-European IT services provider with strong expertise in consulting, systems integration, and outsourcing. Within this new structure, Atos Origin Italy focused on delivering enterprise IT solutions, ERP implementations, infrastructure outsourcing, and digital transformation projects for major Italian clients in banking, telecommunications, manufacturing, and the public sector.

## Historical Context: Beyond the Formative Years

During the tenure at Atos (1999–2000), the company was in the early stages of its international expansion. The unit operated under the Atos Origin brand from 2000 onward, aligning with the group's strategy of expanding across Europe and strengthening its industry verticals. 

It's worth noting that in 2008, Atos Origin decided to divest its Italian operations, and the entire Italian branch was sold to Engineering Ingegneria Informatica, one of Italy's leading IT services companies. This sale marked the end of the original Atos presence in Italy within the Atos group. When Atos later acquired Siemens IT Solutions & Services in 2011 and rebranded globally as Atos, the original Italian business was no longer part of the group, having continued its journey under Engineering's ownership.
