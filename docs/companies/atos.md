# Atos

## Company Overview

**Atos** is an international information technology services and consulting company. Atos Italy was established in the late 1990s as part of the French IT services group Atos, which had been created in 1997 from the merger of Axime and Sligos. In 2000, following the global merger between Atos and the Dutch company Origin B.V., the Italian branch became part of the newly formed **Atos Origin**, a pan-European IT services provider with strong expertise in consulting, systems integration, and outsourcing. Within this new structure, Atos Origin Italy focused on delivering enterprise IT solutions, ERP implementations, infrastructure outsourcing, and digital transformation projects for major Italian clients in banking, telecommunications, manufacturing, and the public sector.

## Technology Focus

- **HP CCM Software** — Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) component for call center operations
- **Ericsson NASP Platform** — Telephony infrastructure and call routing

- **Custom Telephony Solutions** — User Telephony Bar developed by Harpa Italia
- **Infrastructure:** HP Unix systems, HP ProLiant servers, Oracle Database running on Sun 10000 Enterprise (Starfire) machine

### Project Focus: Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) Project 119

As an Integration Consultant, tenure was entirely allocated to **Project 119** for Telecom Italia Mobile—a comprehensive call center technical and software architecture initiative supporting the emergency and customer service line (119 number).

**Project Architecture:**
- **Telephony Layer:** Ericsson NASP platform for call switching and routing
- **CTI Component:** HP CCM Software (primary Atos responsibility)
- **User Interface:** Custom Telephony Bar developed by Harpa Italia
- **CRM Integration:** Siebel CRM (customized by Accenture) backed by Oracle Database on Sun 10000 Enterprise (Starfire)

**Organizational Structure:**
The project operated under a complex contractor ecosystem:
- **Primary Contractors:** Ericsson (telephony), HP (CTI/telephony bar), Accenture (CRM customization)
- **System Integrators:** Atos, Pride, Sema, and others—each with distinct relationships to primary contractors
- **Oversight:** Telesoft (Telecom Italia Group company) providing architectural governance
- **Work Location:** Primary office at TIM Via Tiburtina (Rome); frequent visits to TIM Via di Tor Pagnotta office

### Role and Responsibilities

Primary responsibilities encompassed production and pre-production support:
- Production and pre-production testing and readiness activities
- Hardware system administration and management
- Cross-component technical coordination and troubleshooting
- Waterfall release cycle support, including off-hours deployments during planned maintenance windows (nights and weekends)
- Collaboration with technical teams representing all system components

### Technology Evolution and Infrastructure

The call center technology stack was entirely proprietary, representing the enterprise telecommunications landscape of the late 1990s:
- Tightly coupled vendor-specific systems with minimal interoperability
- Reliance on specialized hardware platforms (HP Unix, Sun servers)
- Complex custom development required for basic integrations
- Waterfall release cycles with scheduled maintenance windows
- No cloud infrastructure, no virtualization, on-premise everything

### Role Evolution and Learning

The Integration Consultant role at Atos provided intensive exposure to enterprise systems administration and hardware management—foundational competencies in the pre-cloud era. Primary learning included:

- **System Administration:** HP Unix system management, infrastructure support, troubleshooting complex hardware configurations
- **Hardware Management:** Sun and HP server operations, performance monitoring, capacity planning
- **Release Management:** Waterfall cycle planning, deployment coordination, off-hours change management
- **Cross-functional Collaboration:** Working across multiple vendors and system integrators, managing complex technical dependencies
- **Production Support:** Real-time issue resolution, system stability monitoring, root cause analysis

This was formative experience in understanding enterprise IT infrastructure, vendor relationships, and the operational complexity of integrating proprietary systems.

## Colleagues and Culture

Working on Project 119 provided exposure to a diverse technical ecosystem. The team included representatives from multiple system integrators (Atos, Pride, Sema, and others), each with their own relationship to primary contractors. Telesoft, as the Telecom Italia Group company overseeing the project, provided architectural governance and coordination. 

While demanding—with frequent off-hours work during planned maintenance windows and waterfall release cycles—the project exposed professionals across organizations to complex system integration challenges and the necessity of coordinating across vendor boundaries. This cross-organizational learning environment was characteristic of enterprise system integration work in the late 1990s.

## Historical Context: Beyond the Formative Years

During the tenure at Atos (1999–2000), the company was in the early stages of its international expansion. The unit operated under the Atos Origin brand from 2000 onward, aligning with the group's strategy of expanding across Europe and strengthening its industry verticals. 

It's worth noting that in 2008, Atos Origin decided to divest its Italian operations, and the entire Italian branch was sold to Engineering Ingegneria Informatica, one of Italy's leading IT services companies. This sale marked the end of the original Atos presence in Italy within the Atos group. When Atos later acquired Siemens IT Solutions & Services in 2011 and rebranded globally as Atos, the original Italian business was no longer part of the group, having continued its journey under Engineering's ownership.
