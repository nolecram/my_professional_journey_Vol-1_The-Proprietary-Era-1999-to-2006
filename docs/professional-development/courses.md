## Obsolescence and Enduring Lessons

The specific technologies covered by these training programs—Siebel CRM, Avaya proprietary telephony, HP CCM, Genesys CTI, on-premise infrastructure—have largely been superseded over the past two decades:

- **Siebel CRM** became legacy within Salesforce; cloud-based CRM platforms are now standard
- **Avaya proprietary systems** evolved into IP-based, software-defined communications
- **On-premise infrastructure** largely migrated to cloud platforms

Yet the training documents broader principles that remain relevant:

- **Specialization through formal training** - Converting hands-on learning into structured expertise
- **Awareness of technological transitions** - Staying current with emerging architectural approaches (captured by DTWSSERV course in 2002, presciently ahead of cloud and microservices adoption)
- **Professional discipline** - Project management and quality systems training provided foundational practices applicable across technological eras
- **Organizational alignment** - Training tracked role evolution and organizational change
- **Continuous learning** - Regular engagement with vendor and professional training reflected commitment to skill development throughout career
