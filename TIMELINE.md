# Comprehensive Timeline of Professional Journey

This timeline chronicles a seven-year journey across four companies in Rome, Italy—a journey defined by technological transition, company transformation, and continuous professional development. From late 1990s proprietary systems through the emergence of open standards, from entry-level technical roles through increasingly senior positions, each year brought mentors who guided, colleagues who inspired, and customers who challenged and trusted.

Every entry in this timeline represents more than a professional milestone; it reflects the support systems, learning opportunities, and technological shifts that shaped professional perspective. The progression from foundational technologies through increasingly complex integrations and business solutions was made possible by organizations that invested in people and believed in continuous growth.

This documentation serves as grateful recognition of that investment and the teams who contributed to this professional development journey.
