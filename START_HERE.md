## 🎨 Tone Reminder

This repository is:
- ✅ A **thank you note** to four companies and the people who made your journey possible
- ✅ A **time capsule** of late 1990s/early 2000s enterprise IT in Rome
- ✅ **Honest** about technological obsolescence (it's a feature, not a bug)
- ✅ **Grateful** for the learning and mentorship
- ✅ **Concise** — no bloat, every detail purposeful
- ✅ **Human-centered** — focused on people and learning, not technical specs

This is NOT:
- ❌ A résumé or portfolio
- ❌ Marketing material for companies or products
- ❌ Technical documentation
- ❌ A claim that old technologies are still relevant

## ✨ Repository Philosophy

> This is a **tribute to a time, not a claim about its relevance.**

The technologies from 1999-2006 are completely obsolete. That's not a weakness—it's exactly what makes this time capsule valuable. You're documenting:
- The people who mentored you
- The companies that invested in your growth
- The era that shaped your professional perspective
- The learning that transcended the specific technologies

**That** is what matters. The gratitude. The relationships. The growth.
