# My Professional Formative Journey (1999–2006)

## Why This Repository

This is a thank you note. To four companies in Rome. To the managers, colleagues, and teammates who invested time in learning and growth. To a time that shaped how I approach problems and work with people—not in the specifics of the technology, which has mostly become obsolete, but in the principles of coordination, responsibility, and care.

The late 1990s and early 2000s were a distinctive moment in enterprise IT: proprietary systems still felt permanent, the internet was just beginning to reshape business, and the work centered on bringing different vendor platforms together to actually function. It was challenging work in ways that modern cloud-native systems aren't—the constraints were tighter, the mistakes more costly, the learning more immediate.

This repository is a walk back through those years. A time capsule, not a resume. It captures the memory of who I worked with, what I learned, and the gratitude for that foundation.
