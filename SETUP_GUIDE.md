- How technologies evolved
- Professional growth and learning

✅ **How to frame it:**
- As a "time capsule" of that era
- With gratitude for the learning opportunities
- Acknowledging how technology has changed
- Connecting historical context to modern understanding
- Personal perspective on professional development
